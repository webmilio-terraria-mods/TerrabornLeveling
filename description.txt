Skill trees inspired (if not stolen) by The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. This is a prototype and was never finished: I'll keep working on it depending on the feedback.
You can find the repository [url=https://github.com/webmilio-terraria-mods/TerrabornLeveling](here) if you want to contribute or report bugs. I also check the comments.

Thank you to Gotest for making the UI basis for this mod.
Thanks to all the people who contributed ideas for the perks, skills, etc.
